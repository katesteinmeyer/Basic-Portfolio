# Homework - Putting it all together

Continuing building on portfolio, one possible layout:

Five main sections:

Header - title and logo
Left sidebar - site nav, should float left and have a width of 25%
Main body - the meat of your page, should include a few paragraphs
Right sidebar - external links, should float right have a width of 25%
Footer - more site nav
Add a simple contact form and use http://formspree.io/ as your form action

Play around with different color and font schemes
